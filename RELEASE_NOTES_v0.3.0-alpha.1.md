# Release Notes - v0.3.0-alpha.1

**Release Date:** December 2024  
**Focus:** Virtual Workspaces & Monorepo Support

This alpha release introduces Rune's Virtual Workspace system, bringing Perforce-style client views and sparse checkout to Git-style distributed version control.

## 🚀 New Features

### Virtual Workspaces
- **Sparse Checkout** – Focus on relevant code with pattern-based virtual roots
- **Monorepo Support** – Efficiently work with large repositories 
- **Performance Guardrails** – Automatic protection against large files and excessive checkout
- **Role-based Views** – Different workspace configurations for different team roles

### Workspace Management Commands

- `rune workspace add-root <name> <pattern>` – Add focused directory patterns
- `rune workspace toggle <name>` – Enable/disable virtual roots
- `rune workspace list` – Show workspace configuration
- `rune workspace validate` – Check for configuration issues
- `rune workspace limits` – Configure performance boundaries

### Performance Features
