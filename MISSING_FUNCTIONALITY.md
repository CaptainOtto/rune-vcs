- [ ] Automatic submodule operations

## 🎨 GUI/Visual Client Requirements (Phase 8)

### 🖥️ **Core GUI Features Needed**
- [ ] Repository browser with file tree
- [ ] Visual commit graph and branch visualization
- [ ] Interactive merge conflict resolution
- [ ] Visual diff tools (side-by-side, unified)
- [ ] Drag-and-drop file operations
- [ ] Visual staging area (like GitKraken/SourceTree)
- [ ] Branch management GUI
- [ ] Remote repository management
- [ ] Settings and configuration GUI

### 🔄 **P4V-Style Workflow Features**

## 🚀 Implementation Priority for Immediate Use

### ⚡ **Phase 8.1: Essential CLI Completions (1-2 weeks)**
1. **Tag Management** - Critical for release workflows
2. **Branch Operations** - Complete create/delete/rename functionality  
3. **Enhanced Merge** - Conflict resolution and abort/continue
4. **Interactive Staging** - `add -p` and `add -i` for selective commits
5. **File Restoration** - `checkout -- <file>` and `reset HEAD <file>`

### ⚡ **Phase 8.2: Visual Client Foundation (2-3 weeks)**
1. **Repository Browser** - File tree with status indicators
2. **Visual Commit Graph** - Branch visualization
3. **Basic Diff Viewer** - Side-by-side file comparison
4. **Merge Conflict GUI** - Visual resolution tools
5. **Branch Manager** - Create/delete/switch branches visually

### ⚡ **Phase 8.3: Advanced Workflows (2-3 weeks)**
1. **Interactive Rebase GUI** - Squash/edit/reorder commits
2. **Advanced Merge Tools** - Three-way merge visualization  
3. **File History Viewer** - Visual timeline per file
4. **Workspace Management** - P4V-style file status views
5. **Remote Management GUI** - Visual remote configuration

## 🎯 Ready-to-Use Assessment

**Current State**: Rune VCS has a solid foundation with:
- ✅ LFS system (superior to Git LFS)
- ✅ Remote operations (server deployment ready)
- ✅ AI intelligence features
- ✅ Performance monitoring
- ✅ Docker deployment infrastructure

**Missing for Daily Use**: 
- 🚨 Complete branch management
- 🚨 Tag management  
- 🚨 Visual merge tools
- 🚨 Interactive staging

**Estimate to Production Ready**: 4-6 weeks
- 2 weeks: Essential CLI completions
- 2-4 weeks: Basic visual client

This would provide a fully functional Git/P4V replacement for your projects.
