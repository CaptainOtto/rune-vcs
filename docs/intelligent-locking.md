# Intelligent File Locking System

Rune's revolutionary intelligent file locking system provides intelligent conflict prevention and file management across any development workflow.

## Overview

Traditional version control systems struggle with:

- **Binary file conflicts** that are impossible to merge
- **Large asset management** without proper tracking
- **Team coordination** on shared resources
- **Release management** with complex file dependencies
- **Cross-platform file handling** differences

Rune's intelligent locking solves these problems with:

- ‚ú® **Smart Project Detection** - Automatically detects your project type and configures optimal settings
- üîí **Intelligent Lock Management** - Context-aware locking based on file types and usage patterns
- üéØ **Conflict Prevention** - Proactive detection and prevention of merge conflicts
- üì¶ **LFS Integration** - Automatic suggestions for large file storage
- üîÑ **Branch-Aware Cleanup** - Smart lock inheritance and release management

## Getting Started

### 1. Auto-Detection

```bash
# Detect your project type and enable intelligent features
rune lock detect

# Output examples:
# üéÆ Game development project detected!
# üåê Web development project detected!
# üìä Data science project detected!
# üé® Design asset project detected!
```

### 2. Basic Locking

```bash
# Lock files with intelligent reasoning
rune lock lock src/main.rs --reason development
rune lock lock assets/texture.psd --reason conflict
rune lock lock data/large_dataset.csv --reason large

# View current lock status
rune lock status
```

### 3. File Analysis

```bash
# Analyze files for lock recommendations
rune lock analyze assets/character_model.fbx
# Output:
# üîç Analysis: assets/character_model.fbx
#   Type: Media(Model3D)
#   Size: 45.2 MB
#   Merge Strategy: BinaryReplace
#   Conflict Risk: 90%
#   Lock Status: Unlocked
#   ‚ö†Ô∏è High conflict risk - consider locking
#   üì¶ Large file - consider LFS
```

### 4. LFS Recommendations

```bash
# Get intelligent LFS suggestions
rune lock lfs-suggestions
# Output:
# üì¶ LFS Candidates Found:
#   assets/textures/character_diffuse.png (15.2 MB)
#   models/environment.fbx (67.8 MB)
#   audio/background_music.wav (25.4 MB)
#
# Run 'git lfs track' for these files to improve performance
```

## Advanced Features

### Smart Lock Reasons

**Development Locks**

```bash
rune lock lock src/ --reason development
```

- Prevents conflicts during active development
- Automatically released when switching branches (configurable)

**Release Locks**

```bash
rune lock lock config/production.json --reason release
```

- Protects critical files during release preparation
- Cleaned up automatically after release tagging

**Conflict Prevention**

```bash
rune lock lock shared/database_schema.sql --reason conflict
```

- High-risk files that frequently cause merge conflicts
- Remains locked until explicitly released

**Large File Operations**

```bash
rune lock lock data/training_set.csv --reason large
```

- Prevents multiple users from modifying large files simultaneously
- Suggests LFS tracking automatically

### Branch Management

**Automatic Cleanup on Branch Switch**

```bash
# Lock files on feature branch
rune lock lock components/new_feature.tsx --reason development

# Switch branches - locks are intelligently managed
git checkout main
# üîÑ Cleaning up locks for branch switch: feature/new-ui ‚Üí main
#   üîì Released lock: components/new_feature.tsx
```

**Manual Branch Cleanup**

```bash
rune lock cleanup-branch feature/old-branch main
```

### Release Management

**Release Lock Cleanup**

```bash
# After creating a release tag
git tag v1.2.0
rune lock cleanup-release v1.2.0
# üöÄ Performing release lock cleanup for: v1.2.0
#   üîì Released release lock: config/version.json
#   üîì Released release lock: docs/changelog.md
# ‚ú® Release cleanup complete!
```

## Configuration

The intelligent locking system automatically configures itself based on your project type, but you can customize the behavior:

### Lock Management Settings

- **Intelligent Locking**: Enable/disable smart lock decisions
- **Auto-unlock on Branch**: Automatically release locks when switching branches
- **Release Lock Cleanup**: Clean up locks after release tagging
- **Lock Timeout**: Automatic lock expiration (default: 24 hours)
- **Lock Inheritance**: How locks are inherited between branches

### File Handling Settings

- **Binary File Detection**: Automatically detect binary files
- **Large File LFS**: Suggest LFS for files over size threshold
- **Conflict Prevention**: Proactive conflict detection
- **Metadata Cleanup**: Clean up file metadata

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Lock conflicts between team members**

```bash
# Force unlock if necessary (use carefully)
rune lock unlock src/main.rs --force

# Check who owns locks
rune lock status
```

**Locks not being released on branch switch**

```bash
# Check configuration
rune config get intelligence.lock_management.auto_unlock_on_branch

# Manual cleanup
rune lock cleanup-branch old-branch new-branch
```

**LFS suggestions not appearing**

```bash
# Ensure file handling is enabled
rune config get intelligence.file_handling.large_file_lfs

# Force analysis
rune lock analyze large_file.zip
```

### Best Practices

1. **Use appropriate lock reasons** - This helps team members understand intent
2. **Regular cleanup** - Use release cleanup to prevent lock accumulation
3. **Configure for your workflow** - Adjust settings based on team size and project type
4. **Monitor lock status** - Regular `rune lock status` checks prevent conflicts
5. **LFS early and often** - Follow LFS suggestions to improve performance

## API Integration

The intelligent locking system integrates with Rune's JSON API for team servers:

```bash
# Start team server with locking support
rune api --with-shrine --addr 0.0.0.0:7421

# Team members can query lock status remotely
curl http://team-server:7421/api/locks/status
```

## Future Enhancements

- **Machine Learning Conflict Prediction**: Learn from your team's patterns
- **IDE Integration**: Real-time lock status in VS Code, JetBrains IDEs
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated lock management in build pipelines
- **Advanced Analytics**: Lock usage statistics and optimization suggestions
- **Custom Rules Engine**: Define project-specific locking policies

---

The intelligent file locking system represents a revolutionary approach to version control that adapts to your workflow rather than forcing you to adapt to it. Whether you're building games, web applications, data science projects, or managing design assets, Rune's intelligent locking keeps your team productive and conflict-free.
